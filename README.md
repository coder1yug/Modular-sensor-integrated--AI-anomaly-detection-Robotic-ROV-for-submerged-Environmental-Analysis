This project presents a modular Biosensor-integrated Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) designed for submerged environmental analysis with a main objective on coral-reef health assessment using the incentives of AI networks. The system is engineered to support environmental monitoring tasks particularly in coral-reef ecosystems which are estimated to sustain up to 94% of marine life according to recent ecological studies. The platform incorporates high-accuracy CTD sensors and a suite of biosensors capable of detecting biological and chemical indicators of reef stress. These measurements are supported by hydrodynamic framing, multi-vector thruster placement, and a stabilized sensor suite that enhances data fidelity under varying flow conditions.
A computational analysis module integrates CTD and biosensor data with computer-vision based species identification and anomaly detection allowing real-time classification of irregular patterns such as bleaching signatures and water-quality deviations. A two-axis manipulator arm maneuvered by a differential gear mechanism and equipped with a precision claw that allows controlled physical sampling and interaction with delicate substrates, for simplicity on a custom water sampling system.
Comparative analysis against advanced U.S. ROV systems shows performance gaps in tether bandwidth, thrust-to-weight ratio, and autonomous correction algorithms, while also prototypeing strengths in sensor integration, modularity, and low-cost mechanical efficiency. Making this ROV a significantly better operation than US ROV’s .This work demonstrates that a compact, accessible, and computationally enhanced ROV can serve as a viable tool for coral-reef research and environmental monitoring particularly for institutions with limited resources.
